React
    - Creating a react app is a large task that we can use toolchains to do for us.
    - There are a lot of toolchains that server different purposes but here are the bigger ones: Create React App, Next.js, Gatsby, and Parcel.

Create React App
    - Now that the CRA is installed we can use it to create a new react app.
    - npx create-react-app "file-name"
    - This command is run with npx (nod package executable).

Intro to .jsx
    - JSX stands for javascript expressions and runs perfectly fine in a .js file too.
    - This language allows us to type HTML style code in a JS format.
    - The biggest advantage is allowing us to do calcutltaions or conditional checking alongside the page rendering.

Using .jsx
    - When you are creating components or anything that is rendered with the index.js file you can instead use .jsx.
    - .jsx should only be used with files that are capitalized.
    - You can use JS or JSX bit the benefit to JSX is the use of emmet and auto-fill of the HTML elements.

Using Code in JSX`
    - The way to code in JSX is surrounding it in {}.
    - This informs the code to treat everything inside of the brackets as regular JS.
    - If you want anything to render than you need to "return" if from the component function.
    - Lastly, just like JS, when you return something the code stops.
