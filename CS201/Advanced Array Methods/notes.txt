Ternaries
    - This is just a quick reminder about how ternaries work, think of them as small if statements.
    - { conditional ? truePath : falsePath }

Spread Operator
    - The spread operator (...) will iterate through and add all values from an attay-like object.
    Ex.
        book = {
            title: 'Coding',
            pages: 123,
            cover: 'hard-cover'
        }
        bookV2 = {
            ...book,
            pages: 140,
            author: 'Steve'
        }
    - Book Version 2 will have all the same values but we changed pages to 140 and added an author property.

Mapping Arrays
    - When you have an array with several items that you want to break down the best is .map().
    - .map() is an array method that will go through each of the items and do a thing.
    - The nice part of .map() is taht it returns a whole new array when it's finished.
    - Other methods such as forEach() does not create new arrays and instead just pastes content for the existing array.

Anatomy of .map()
    - The first part of a map metod is a variable name that will represent each item from your array.
    Ex.
        let newArray = people.map(person => {
    - This variable name should be named as the singualr or the array.
    Ex.
        people => person
        books => book
    - Next you can destructure your item if you like, this not required but does make the setup easier.
    Ex.
        let newArray = people.map(person => {
            const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet } = person;
    - Lastly you need to return the react element from the map.
    - This return a new HTML for each item in the array.
    Ex.
        let newArray = people.map(person => {
            const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet } = person;
            return {...person, shirtColor: 'tie-dye', isNice: 'yes'};
        });

.forEach()
    - forEach() doesn't return an array as an output.
    - You hvae 3 values taht you can use to work with, value, index, and array (the entire thing).
    - The last export of a forEach() loop is 'undefined'. This really messes with returnign values.
    - Instead you can have a conditional that acts depending on the values returned. Counting occurences, breaking up the array into smaller arrays, printing out every name that starts with A, etc.

.filter()
     - filter() is how you can remove certain items form your array.
    - It will go through each item and compare them to a conditional that you set up, true gets added and false does not.

.every()
    - This checks to make sure that EVERY value meets the condition.
    Ex.
        const numbers = [-1, -2, 20, 40, 50];
        console.log(numbers.every(num => num < 100));

.some()
    - This is very similar to .every() but instead of checking all, it checks in there are any that are true.
    - As long as one is true this will return a true statement.

.reduce()
    - reduce() is a method that adds to an output, it finds the accumulation of numbers.
    - This does nothing for non-number values, this is very useful for creating updated numbres of items.
    Ex.
        const array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
        array.reduce(total, current, index, arr => {
            return total + current;
        }, 20);
    - Total is a variable that is automatically returned when the method end.
    - Current is a variable referring to the value currently being looked at.
    - You can choose how this number will affect the total (here it is added).
    - Lastly is the optional starting value.
    - This is outside of the callback function and sets the total value so that you can start at any value.
